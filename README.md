# FDAP (Financial Data Analysis and Practice) Student Resources

This repository supplements material available on the FIN 6200 Canvas page. It mainly exists to provide accessible URLs for shared data files (in `/data/`) and template notebook files (in `/templates/`).

- [Data files](https://github.com/lukestein-classes/fdap_public/tree/main/data)
- [Template notebooks](https://github.com/lukestein-classes/fdap_public/tree/main/templates)

You can run the template notebooks in your web browser using Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lukestein-classes/fdap_public/HEAD). Note that you **must** download saved versions of any changes you make to Binder notebooks if you'd like to keep them; they are **not** saved for you in the cloud.

You can also run template notebooks in your web browser using Google Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lukestein-classes/fdap_public/blob/master), though these notebooks will not be able to access data in the repository.

## Python

### Installation
You can run Python notebooks in the cloud using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Binder](https://mybinder.org), but will probably want a local installation. I strongly recommend you use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Python distribution.

Anaconda includes (almost) everything you need to get going, but in line with [these recommendations](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/code-preliminaries.html#installing-an-integrated-development-environment-ide), I prefer to work in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with some add-in extensions.
