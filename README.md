# FDAP (Financial Data Analysis and Practice) Student Resources

This repository has material that supplements what is supplements on the FIN 6200 Canvas page. It exists mainly to provide publicly accessible URLs for shared data files (in `/data/`) and template notebook files (in `/templates/`).

- [Data files](https://github.com/lukestein-classes/fdap_public/tree/main/data)
- [Template notebooks](https://github.com/lukestein-classes/fdap_public/tree/main/templates)

You can run the notebooks in your web browser using Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lukestein-classes/fdap_public/HEAD). Note that you **must** download saved versions of any changes you make to Binder notebooks if you'd like to keep them; they are **not** saved for you in the cloud.

Notebooks can also be run using Google Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lukestein-classes/fdap_public/blob/master), though you may not be able to access data in the repository.

## Python

### Installation
Python notebooks can run in the cloud using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Binder](https://mybinder.org), but will probably want a local installation. I strongly recommend using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Python distribution.

Anaconda includes (almost) everything you need to get going, but in line with [these recommendations](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/code-preliminaries.html#installing-an-integrated-development-environment-ide), I prefer to work in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with some add-in extensions.
