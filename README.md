# FDAP (Financial Data Analysis and Practice) Student Resources

This repository supplements material available on the FIN 6200 Canvas page. It mainly exists to provide accessible URLs for shared data files (in `/data/`) and template notebook files (in `/templates/`).

You can also run the template notebooks in your web browser using Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lukestein-classes/fdap_public/HEAD). Note that you **must** download saved versions of any changes you make to Binder notebooks if you'd like to keep them; they are **not** saved for you in the cloud.
