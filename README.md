# Student Resource Repository for FDAP

This repository supplements material available on our course Canvas page. It mainly exists to provide publicly accessible URLs for shared data files (in `/data/`) and template notebook files (in `/templates/`).

You can also run the template notebooks in your web browser using Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lukestein-classes/fdap_public/HEAD). Note that you **must** download saved versions of any changes you make to Binder notebooks if you'd like to keep them; they are **not** saved for you in the cloud.
