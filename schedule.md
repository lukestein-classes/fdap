# Schedule

This course schedule **will** change during the semester. Topic changes may be ad hoc. Any meeting change announcements distributed via Discord; please ensure that you are monitoring the `#announcements` channel there.

We will also have several **combined meetings** where multiple sections will meet simultaneously (typically to accommodate a guest). These will of course be announced in advance, but please aim to be available during all course section times (9:45–11am, 11:45am–1:00pm, and 1:15pm–2:30pm).
