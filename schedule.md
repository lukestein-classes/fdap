# Schedule

This course schedule **will** change during the semester. Ad hoc topic changes (unannounced) will be based on current events or class pace and interest. Announcement of any meeting changes will be distributed via Discord; please ensure that you are monitoring the `#announcements` channel there.

To see a constantly updated version of the schedule, please just scroll down on this page to the "[Updated schedule](#updated-schedule)" section, which I will use to track what we *actually* do.

Midterm and final examinations are scheduled for **Friday, February 27** and **Monday, May 4**, respectively.
